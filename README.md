# Caffeine
Very simple,Vanilla JS working browser bassed chat overlay for caffeine.tv

Usage:
Clone or download

Lets pretend you have the folder "chat" on your desktop, just create a new browser sourse in OBS and link it to the index.html
EG: file:///C:/Users/LordRampantHump/Desktop/chat/index.html (do not forget the file://)
Set the size how you want.

You need to add the client stage id for caffeine so the script knows who its connecting to
find yours here: https://api.caffeine.tv/v1/users/kaph, just change the username: 

You can change some other properties too inside the app.js file.

Thats it!
